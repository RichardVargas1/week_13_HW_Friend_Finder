# week_13_HW_Friend_Finder

This is my version of a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. Which is esstially just another dating app. I will take in results from users' surveys. These surveys will be matched up with answers from other users of this dating app. The final result, will display a name & photo of a user, with another user, with the best match. THe match will of course be based off of the answers from the user submitted surveys.
